1. This course has been initially setup with React 18 CDN links, but as of making this repo, React no more recommends CDNs. so as you can see in the second commit of the repo, we added two CDN scripts, one is about React and another is about REACT DOM. the reason for this differentiation is because React now also has things like React Native and React 360, so the first script "React" handles all the features/library for core react and the "React DOM" handles specfic parts that is needed for Broswer Rendering.
2. The first thing that goes into notice is that React uses PascalCase as the naming convention for its components. Why : because then it will be easy to distinguish between regular HTML elements and React components.
